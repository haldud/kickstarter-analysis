# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is fundraising for her play titled *Fever*. We have been analyzing data from several thousand other crowdfunding projects to find trends and to identify usefult insights. The analysis will be provided to Louise to help her make decisions in her quest to reach her fundraising goals.

### Purpose
The most recent update we have from Louise is that her play *Fever* came close reaching the goals in a short amount of time. We will be comparing how other campaigns performed relative to the following two factors:
1. Launch date - can we uncover any trends as it relates to a launch date of a kickstarter?
2. Funding goals - does the fundrasing goal seem to have an impact on the success of a campaign?

## Analysis and Challenges
We performed our analysis with Microsoft Excel. Excel is an extremely powerful tool for analyzing data containing approximately less than one million rows. Our data set of kickstarter data contained just over 4,000 rows so Excel was the perfect tool to find valuable information for Louise.

The kickstarter spreadsheet that we have been analyzing can be found here: ![Kickstarter](https://github.com/haldud/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
