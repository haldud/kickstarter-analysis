# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is fundraising for her play titled *Fever*. We have been analyzing data from several thousand other crowdfunding projects to find trends and to identify usefult insights. The analysis will be provided to Louise to help her make decisions in her quest to reach her fundraising goals.

### Purpose
The most recent update we have from Louise is that her play *Fever* came close reaching the goals in a short amount of time. We will be comparing how other campaigns performed relative to the following two factors:
1. Launch date - can we uncover any trends as it relates to a launch date of a kickstarter?
2. Funding goals - does the fundrasing goal seem to have an impact on the success of a campaign?

## Analysis and Challenges

## Summary
Based on the analysis performed, it would benefit Louise to launch her campaing in the month of May.

Being in theater category and play subcategory, Louise will have around a 60% chance of succeeding in the US.

Louise can also improve her chances of succeeding by lowering the amount that she'd like to raise. Analyzing the data of her favorite GB plays, tells us that her goal should be less than $4,000. The average goal for those was $4,060 and the highest pledged amount that does not include outliers is $3,015.
